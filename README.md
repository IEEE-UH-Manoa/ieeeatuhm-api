If you're new to web development but you've taken a programming course before (EE 160 perhaps?), here
are some concepts that you should be familiar with before getting involved with this particular project:

* Javascript
* Asynchronous Callbacks
* Node.js
* Git
* GitHub
* Git Flow 

If you're completely new to development or you're looking to learn some of the concepts above, stop
by the IEEE chatroom (chat.ieeeatuhm.com) and ping me (Kenny Luong) for some help. I'll be more than
happy to point you in the right direction.
